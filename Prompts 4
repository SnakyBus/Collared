Collared Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

>All that talk of taking the planet conquest by glorious battle, of daring hero marines dropping in on other worlds and cleaving our way through the cities of these screeching chittering monsters till they cried uncle and is cool and all, sure you can take a concubine rape-slave out of it and sure that’s your base rapist impulse satiated..but that’s shallow, I live amidst a brooding generation barely to young to have experienced their civilization get so blown the fuck out that their old societies got swept aside in narry the blink of an and these near-feral things now swoon over and emulate humanity badly.
>I sit across from a young Dxlaxian Fleshrender, primitive predator alien pack hunters. The thing is multiple heads and shoulders larger then any man and strength doubly so. Yet she we are having a picnic and she
>She picks the flowers and wears the pretty bow because that’s what she thinks human women would do. That her kind don’t need to shade their nonexistang eyes or that her chinaware utensils can scarcely be seen to be holdable by her.

>COLLARED.com: To Humans living in anthro-dominated nations, have you found any difficulty in finding pets to collar? Is it hard keeping them and their devotion to Humans a secret?
Due to the repercussions me and my pet could possibly face by revealing our names, I wish to remain anonymous. As for your question, I believe that the difficulty in acquiring a pet depends on a multitude of factors, many of which are simply up to chance and the natural instincts of the anthro you're trying to collar. In my case, I didn't even need to try, as she practically collared herself the moment we met.
You see, a few years ago the company I worked for had sent me to work as a translator at one of their overseas offices in the frozen hellscape that is ‘Furland’. For those less geographically knowledgeable, Furland is a small nation located in the Northern Arctic region of Queredean. They're society is very anthro dominated, and they mostly make their money off of the many oil reservoirs that dot their frosty land.
Now the office I was supposed to work in is located within a city, however, my company in their infinite wisdom had set me up with a rental house about an hour away from the city and I wasn't able to acquire a driver's license, so I was forced to take the bus to and from the city.
Well one day in early December, I was sitting alone in the bus stop’s shelter, shivering and feeling absolutely miserable, when a doe stepped into the shelter with me. She looked at me with a curious expression as she noticed me and greeted me. I of course said hello back and she asked me if I knew how to speak Furrish (their national language). I said that I knew a little and she giggled and asked if I was cold, which I responded with a nod. Then, she asked something that I didn't quite understand.
“Hawuatko wämmitewwä~ kun odotamme bussia?”
I was able to make out a few of the words, but I was unable to fully comprehend her question. So I asked her if she could repeat what she had said, but she just laughed at turned around before taking her phone out of her jacket pocket and tapping away at it. As she typed something into her phone, I couldn't help but notice how plump her ass was, especially for a deer. I thought about trying to flirt with her, but before I could say anything, she looked over her shoulder at me and asked in broken English “Wanna warm up while waiting for bus?” as she pulled down her pants and showed me her rear. I was quiet for a moment, as I was sort of shocked by how open she was, but then I nodded and smiled before standing up.
She turned and placed her hands on the wall of the shelter and I got behind her and undid my belt. The rest was sort of a blur, but I do remember that we both decided to skip whatever we were going to do that day, and I dragged her back to my house to continue our romp session.
That was a few months ago, and now she has become my secret live-in pet and the mother of our future children. I’m currently trying to get her the paperwork to bring her back to my home country, but once I do I’m going to get her a nice collar to wear.

>twas the night before Christmas, and all was not well, and all because I was not feeling swell
>No woman to be with on Christmas had made em real stressed, so in spite of the parties I went home for a rest
>I set a fire in the hearth- and sat in my lair, and out the window to the snow I just sat and stared
“Oh Saint Nick, hear my plight. Women of the world give me such a fright. They’re nasty, and mean, they think I’m unclean- and worst of all they treat me like trash unless I bring big stacks of green”

>“Merry Christmas my boy, I hope the gifts make you happy. Now you don’t have to worry about your women treating you crappy”
>he smiled with his red rosy cheeks making great big dimples, then back to the chimney he hauled himself real simple
>he hauled his bag to his shoulders and reached for a treat. He chuckled again- warmly like the suns heat

A Frontier Operative's Account of the Domestication of the Uberi Tribe, 451 AU
>The Uberi Tribe was an elk anthro tribe off the west border of the Empire, estimated to number around 500 in total population. In accordance to current standards, attempts to negotiate diplomatic concessions from them were made, in return for the protection of their tribe, through legal restrictions on hunting. They summarily refused this offer. A threat of force was made, followed by an offer to establish them as a vassal tributory, which was similarly refused. Thus, in the year of our Father 451, by Imperial decree, the Uberi Tribe was deemed a just and righteous target of conquest, and a casus belli of conquest was formally issued upon them.
>The Uberi Tribe was not an unusually large, or even noteworthy tribe, simply one of the many multitudes of anthro tribes throughout the wildlands. It was merely one amongst several targets of conquest already issued this year, and it's domestication was expected to be a routine affair. And so, Imperial military leadership saw fit to delegate only a single centuria to the task, knowing that the force's numbers would be bolstered by independent forces and hunter-mercenaries. This is where I joined the encampment, and my personal accounting may begin.
>The encampment based itself out of Camuth, a small border town nearest to the Uberi tribal grounds. There, 80-odd Imperial soldiers, in addition to their commanding officers and attached logistics division, made up the 100 men of the assigned centuria. Independent operators such as myself needed only to register credentials with the centurian commander in order to join the war party.
>From the town of Camuth, about 15 or so members of their civil militia did so, which was most of their militia's number. For a small, rural border town like this, any number of anthro slaves would be a significant boon, and the chance to acquire them through right of personal conquest was an opportunity too valuable to pass up.
>Travelling here from elsewhere to join to domestication assault were a few dozen independent operatives like myself, bearing hunting or chattel trading licenses. Many of them were hunter-mercenaries registered with the Hunter's Lodge, with two of them even bearing rare gunpowder weapons, licensed to wield them by Imperial high writ of recognition, something of which I would just like to note I was NOT in any way jealous of.
>Preparations were made, supplies were gathered, and the orders were outlined. Imperial decree was for this to be a domestication, not a simple culling. So efforts would be made to keep as many anthros as possible alive, even the males. We were to march fast on the tribal village with the sun at our back, falling upon them swiftly while a smaller detachment flanked the other side of the village to encircle them and capture any fleeing anthros.
>They outnumbered us significantly, and our planned attack was simple and direct. And yet, none of this would be an issue.
>The next day, we marched swiftly across the plains as planned, a few of the hunters on horseback. The armor of the centurians glistened in the sunlight, and we sent the flanking force ahead as we approached our destination.
>The Uberi village was large, but simple, thankfully located in a mostly clear stretch of grassland rather than within the denser woods. Tents in the style of the plains tribes, with a few segmented barriers of crude wooden stakes here and there around the perimeter. There would be no calling this a "fortification," for sure. Yet they greeted us undaunted with a hail of arrows as we crested the hill.
>The Uberi Elks must have prepared for our assault in their own way, greatly expanding their armory of bows, for there were more arrows in that initial volley than we had men in our war party.
>But we were no tribal raiding party. Arrows of flint, stone, and bone met Imperial steel, sparking off of armor and clattering against raised shields. The military of the Empire was disciplined and trained, a rows of heavily armored infantry layered in front of the generally more lightly armored volunteers. The shield wall went up, we crouched down, and the most any of those countless arrows achieved were a scant few shallow wounds, barely piercing the leather shoulder armor of a few too-eager young village guards.
>A shout went up for the middle columns to stay down, and the rear forces stood to answer the volley. The centuria had brought not archers, but their famed javelineers, who hurled long steel-tipped rods with strength and precision most impressive. Their fiersome javelins struck with force enough to send Elk men hurtling backwards, staking some to the ground right where they stood. Blood arced across cloth tents, startled cries from the elk defenders drowning out the death rattles of the fallen. They had been struck harder than they'd expected by our counter volley.
>We aimed to capitalize on this. A rallying cry from the centurian commander sent us charging forward, shields up and providing ample coverage from the hasty, intermittent arrows of the still-reeling elk archers. With the defenders scrambling to brace against our charge, the javelineers were left unharried and allowed to swiftly rain javelins down upon the anthros warriors. The sound of javelins splitting the wind, cut off by a meaty thunk and a pained yelp, were frighteningly consistent. After their initial response salvo, the javalineers were now free to aim and throw at their own discretion– and their aim was renowned.
>As we charged, close enough now to see the mixed fear and defiance in the elk stags eyes, the intermittent, thunderous crack of distant gunfire from beyond the village told us that no anthro would be slipping through the net today. The flanking party, lead by the two firearm-wielding bastards hunter-mercenaries, had already denied a retreat party before our frontline had even reached the defender's spears.
>I confess, I've always found it difficult to describe a melee, such as what resulted when our charging forces met their braced spearmen. They always seem to happen in such a blur of adrenaline, the individual moments stretching out forever, but the battle itself over before you even realize. So what can I say for the battle that ensued, other than that it was fierce, and was over very quickly.
>Well, I can say that the elk stags fought well. They had chosen resistance, and so they resisted admirably. I am proud of the two sets of prodigious antlers I returned to my home with, bearing tribal Uberi marking whose meanings will be forgotten within a generation, no longer passed down from father to son. The Uberi stags were worthy of respect, and I honor their memory through these trophies, just as they bring honor upon me.
>But I digress. Suffice to say, the elk warriors were no match for us. After the brave and proud had fallen in scores before the maces and javelins of the Imperial soldiers, along with the various weapons of the rest of us, the rest of their ilk quickly changed their mind about their chosen path of resistance and surrendered. The village was in bedlam, individual human soldiers having pushed all the way into and throughout it during the fighting, leaving panicked doe's and noncombatents dashing between, in, and out of tents. Our forces, joined by the flanking group, had encircled the village properly now, and we let the elkfolk practically rebound off our circled lines as they desperately sought an escape.
>The soldiers did their best to herd them in and tighten the circle, until the villagers quickly realized that there would be no escaping today. Nearly the entire initial population of the village, several hundred elk anthros of all ages, stag and doe, now milled about the village in idle anxiety and fear. Myself and the other hunters combed through the village, coaxing the huddled pockets of stragglers towards the main group as gently as we could, and rendering aid to any wounded who could be saved.
>During these efforts, I nearly tripped over a pretty elk doe, lying in the dirt and looking up at me with fearful, pinprick pupils. The poor thing had twisted her leg in the rushed stampede to escape, and was kicking feebly against the ground in a vain attempt to push herself away from me, yelping whenever she tried to put weight on her injured leg.
>I helped her up gently, as she repeatedly cried out something like "𐌽𐌴 𐌹𐍄𐌰𐌽П 𐌼𐌹𐌺!", in a dialect I couldn't quite place. The Uberi did not use the shared tongue, nor any of the common tribal languages, instead having their own derivative of some kind that was indecipherable to even a polyglot like myself. But despite the language barrier, I was eventually able to convey that I meant her no harm and collected the injured doe, having her rest her weight on my arm as I lead her over to where the other villagers were being gathered.
>Once the whole village had been searched, I took a seat upon a stump in front of the gathering, so that I could have a good view to observe the rest of the proceedings, for the sake of this account. I decided to keep the previously mentioned doe with me for this, feeling somewhat personally responsible for her after helping her limp back through the village, and so I waved off the soldiers who offered to take her off my hands and assured them I'd handle it.
>I'm not sure what the doe inferred from that interaction, as she clearly couldn't understand our words, but she seemed quite grateful that I had kept her from being herded into the main group. She kept close to my side, trembling fearfully and clinging to me like a protector. I had her kneel at my side, leaning over my lap in order to keep the weight off her injured leg. The female deer's head swiveled to follow each armor-clad soldier who passed us, her eyes wide. I can only imagine what she and the other anthros might have feared would be done with them, as the rest were corralled by the Imperial soldiers.
>Guild officials from the Hunter's Lodge handled the evaluation of any individual claims of personal conquest, from hunters wishing to take trophies from stags they had felled, to those who, like me, had a specific anthro or anthros they wished to stake claim on. The Hunter's Lodge takes such things very seriously, and thoroughly investigated each claim, along with the credentials of the claimant, before rendering a verdict on the claim's validity. According to trophy grading standards, a full trophy could only be alloted if the anthro was deemed to have been felled solely by the actions of the claimant. The majority of the fallen anthros were either unclaimed, or their death couldn't be attributed entirely to a sole individual. From these, many antlers would be collected posthumously and graded with the silver mark of collective conquest, before being distributed among the all those who partook in the assault (this was how I came into ownership of my own two sets of Uberi antlers).

>humans work their way into the courts of anthro royalty
>seduce all the highborn women and turn them into spies
>humans control the anthro kingdoms with a network of well fucked spy-sluts

The Galactis Empire, especially in Legends, is I think a good setting for /collared/ material.
>Empire believes in human supremacy and that it is humanity's destined role to rule over all the lesser races
>non-humans lives as seconds class citizen beneath their human betters
>entire species are declared non-sapient and enslaved
>imperial planetary governors live like kings and can have their own harems
Basically imagine if the Imperium of Man instead of outright killing xenos, took the Human Man's Burden approach to galactic domination.

Breed-Lord Log, Day 42: Vixen sisterhood
>The sisterhoods' training is proving...inadequate.
>While there has been an increased display of determination and strength, coordination continues to be nonexistent. Sisterhood members seem to forget their kin the moment battle begins and it becomes a free for all
>While my presence has shown ramped aggression, and they seem to withstand pain to a greater degree (I suspect in an attempt to not appear weak in front of me, and thus prove not worthy of mating).
>Ana Maria in particular is showing remarkable progress, and I hope to foster her loyalty in future generations.
>Victoria however shows a lack of restraint, preferring to tire her opponent out rather than asserting her dominance. She will not be warming my bed tonight.
>The Panda sisterhoods will be compensated adequately the following evening supplying their youngest to this sparring match. Lin and Min have proven to be quite adept, and I am eager to see their creativity passed to a new generation as soon as possible
Breed-Lord Log, Day 49: Vixen sisterhood
>Breed Lord Constantine visited me with an interesting proposal to cull the herds of wild beasts stalking our herds. In addition, he has given me a brood of vixens to expand my own throng. As he states, they are his daughters, and old enough that they need to form their own sisterhood.
>This gift was a gesture of goodwill, to incorporate me into a coalition he has been building. I accepted the vixens with all the pomp and circumstance that etiquette demands.
>While I am grateful that Lord Constantine gifted me the daughters of his sisterhood, integration between the two vixen throngs has been...problematic
>The barracks are a mess as the social hierarchies have been thrown out of order and the new vixens attempt to assert dominance over their new kin
>Constantine's presence has also had an unexpected side effect. A single male is enough to enforce order. I had theorized an additional male human could quell this inter-throng feud.
>It seemed to have intensify the females' natural aggression in some, and hastened the estrus cycle in others.
>Desdemona had been in sync with her sisters since day 1. It appears now she is in heat prematurely. If this is not dealt with I may have a full blown riot on my hands as this chaos spreads to the other sisterhoods on the grounds.
Breed-Lord Log, Day 67: Feline sisterhood
>Constantine's proposal seems rather rash, but I cannot deny the results.
>It is no secret wildlings have greater coordination than their domesticated cousins. Without the comforts of hearth and home, they are forced to adapt quicker for simple survival
>Constantine proposes tracking smaller herds and trapping them
>Their males will be removed and disposed of, and we shall take the place of their males. The theory is that after subject to the stamina of a human, the herd will quickly supplant us as their male superiors, and that wildling coordination can be used to our advantage.
>I was initially skeptical of this until Master Darien showed us the prowess of his Cougar throng.
>The tamed wildlings were able to subdue a larger herd by utilizing trap and ambush tactics! Remarkable forward thinking if only I could get my own sisterhoods to replicate such behavior.
>And apparently the cougar throng did it all for the promise of recreational breeding with Master Darien! Not even to pass on favorable traits! Just, recreation!
>Constantine has identified several wildling herds ripe for capture. He has allowed me to choose for myself. I hope I choose correctly
Breed-Lord Log, Day 72: Panther sisterhood
>I do not understand it.
>The panthers are larger, faster, stronger than the other wildlings around us.
>Yet I struggle to get them to concentrate long enough to subdue a herd smaller than theirs!
>Worse still, Rosa and Isabella just. WILL. NOT. LEAVE. ME. ALONE!
>Their sisters aren't even finished and they are slipping away trying to seduce me.
>I'm starting to wonder if this was less to cull the wildlings and more a practical joke...
Breed-Lord Log, Day X: My Time off
>The coalition has disbanded. It was as much a joke as it was strategy.
>The wildling herd are diminished, and we will be able to enjoy a few years of relative peace until their numbers regrow.
>While my panthers have been a mixed bag, I cannot deny their effectiveness when it came to brute strength.
>And it had an unintended effect of motivating the other sisterhoods to do better. The Vixen and Canine throngs were far more effective this season, even showing coordination between each other, something I had failed to produce in all my years of training. I'm starting to wonder if the females were actually capable all along and were just pretending to secure more breeding sessions with me.
>If so, I'm not upset. If anything Darien has taught me to be a little more loose with my rewards. After all it is as much a treat for myself as the girls.
>I intend to retire for a time and spend some excess time 'training' my new wildling acquisitions.
>End log

>The Nab-A-Fur kit includes:
>A tranquilizer rifle, complete with 10 fast-acting darts
>A DIY bondage kit, for quickly subduing and preparing your new pet for transport
>A mental reconditiong DVD set, for erasing any willpower or pesky memories of past lives
>And of course, a stylish carrier, to show off your new toy while on the go

>"That's the human I told you about! He's a great boss, makes me feel so liberated. I don't have to fight my urges when when working for him."
>"You get paid for jilling all day?"
>"Of course not. I still need to do what he tells me to. But if I want to, I can squirt in the middle of his yard and he won't bat an eye"
>"Does he watch?"
>"I do, sometimes."
>"Hello mr. Anon, Sidney has been telling me about you"
>"Good, I hope"
>"No doubt. Say, have any jobs open?"

>whether they are simply standing in front of a stronger human, bullied at school, or, in one infamous case, a mayor of a small town on stage after he was soundly defeated in a public debate, a furboi will always dump his sperm when challenged
>this is theorized to have evolved as a sign of immediate submission and self-emasculation in the face of a human raider pillaging his village
>strong willed furbois who resisted were killed immediately and the physically strong yet obedient furbois were castrated and taken as slaves
>but the males pathetic enough to spill his seed at the sight of a human approaching his home to rape his family were spared, their weakness and submission making them unsatisfying targets to kill and enslave
>eventually there were no others for the female anthros to mate with, breeding more males with the cum response
>within the confines of history this is just another quirk of the small village life
>in the interconnected modern world this disadvantage has turned furbois into popular targets for pranks and bullying
>in certain cultures when a human first wishes to fuck a female it is a tradition for the top furboi to "guard" his daughter/wife/sister/mother's honor, only allowing the human to pass once he has spilled his semen on the ground from his dominating presence
>it is also considered to be his submission, consent, and blessing
>the human then steps and grinds his foot in the puddle of furboi cum as he enters
>"seeding the earth" is a celebrated event but has also evolved into a greeting for honored human guests
>a foreign human VIP stepping on the puddle of furcum is a highly televised event and the peak of the furboi's life
>this cultural oddity climaxed when thousands of furbois covered the streets with their cum to be driven over by the tanks crewed by their human liberators
>while not great for traction it did draw the soldiers out of their vehicles to savor the hot wives and young daughters presented to them as a reward

The amount of cum spilled also shows how reverent they are.
It's based on their remaining cum rather than actual quantity because of how many furbois can barely manage to squirt more than two strings.
A furboi shooting dust after or during his initial display is considered very respectful, showing he has no cum left in the human's presence.
This also allots him a temporary title of female so that she may be allowed proximity with other females while a human is near, as otherwise he will be forced to leave the room even if it's his own house and the females are his family.
It is normal for furbois to have some cum leftover when submitting to a strange human the first time on the street or as a casual acquaintance as they may run into another soon after.
But it is considered rude to have enough for two more submissions in short succession if they know the human personally.
And it is very disrespectful to have more than that in any setting where a furboi is close to a human.
If they able to still cum after five separate submissions in a short amount of time, that's enough cause for arrest and reeducation.

When you take over an anthro family, the father should ultimately be demoted to a daughter role.

A female family member being chosen for a human's harem is an important day for furbois as it shows he did a good job in helping to nurture the female to be picked.
It is also one of the only ways for a furboi to potentially get a more permanent status as female themselves.
Whether it be his daughter, mother, or "wife" the furboi will immediately give up whatever little power he had in the family to serve the human full time as honorary daughter.
This sparks a little rivalry in the family as the former furboi desperately does all she can to show her worthiness of her new status by pleasing her new master in the hope she'll get some dick as well.
