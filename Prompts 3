Collared Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

Is it better to get a store-bought anthro or to catch one in the wild or on the street?

Depends what you want out of your anthro.
Store-bought ones are submissive and obedient towards humans, making them easy to take care of, whether you want a sex slave, a housemaid, or just a pet.
Street anthros are more intelligent, which comes with useful practcal skills and knowledge, but they are also more used to being considered 'people' and tend to get uppity if they feel mistreated. Regardless, they are still usually subby little sluts, and often their bratty disobedience is just an act to get you to 'punish' them. Fun if you're into rape correction, but I'd avoid sexual punishments if you wanna break them off the habit.

Wild anthros more difficult to handle than their domesticated kin, and I'd discourage picking them as your first anthro, unless you are ready to get your hands dirty. Their demeanor depends on species.
Prey species are skittish and might lash out and run away if you spook them. Being gentle and generous with them long enough to make them feel safe will lead to them becoming more eager to please as they come to depend on you for safety.
On the other hand, barring down on them with overwhelming force will break them in faster, but they tend to lose any trace of personality as they are forcibly reminded of their place in the world. Good if you want a piece of fuckmeat, or a menial slave, bad if you enjoy a more lively companion.
Predator species are proud and haughty, and much more difficult to tame than prey. You are pretty much guaranteed to get into a scrap if you wanna get one home. I'd suggest getting your rabies shots in advance before engaging. As with prey, how you treat them will affect their demeanor. Kindness will get you respect as they will see you more as an Alpha. Such an anthro can be a useful companion, but they may attempt to challenge you if they disagree with your rules. Wrestling them to the ground and asserting your dominance will get them to back down for a while.
If you can't be bothered to deal with such disobedience, using brute force to dominate them again and again will eventually break their spirit. This does take longer than taming them with kindness, however, and you'll suffer more bites and scratches. They will still try and act defiantly, but as soon as you raise a hand in threat, they'll shut up, and if you tell them to do something, they will do it with some grumbling, of course.

>Be Anon, the Human
>Be summon by anthro witch
>She is trying to order you to teach her about the stars and to kill some other bitch
>notice she made a mistake on the protection circle
>this will be fun

>Your wife is a wolf anthro, one very in touch with her instincts since she was a tribal before falling in love with you. She still has the urge to hunt and capture prey like her still-tribal brethren.
>And hunt she does. Your rural home together means ample woodland and privacy.
>Since she's married to you and has joined modern society, your wife doesn't actually need to kill her prey for a meal, so she does something a little more insidious.
>She drags them back alive.
>Something about the primal prey vs predator mindset means your wife, amongst other predators, doesn't really see prey anthros as people. They're little more than objects.
>The phenomenon still has both human and anthro psychologists alike scratching their heads.
>Tail wagging and a smile on her muzzle, your wife presents a bloodied, bound, and terrified doe anthro to you in the bedroom. From the paint in the doe's fur, she's a tribal.
>Then your wife forces the doe facedown, ass up down, spreads her legs, and looks to you with a smile.
>"Since I brought it here," your wife begins cheerfully, referring to the doe trying to cry past her gag. "I decided to present it to you as a gift, husband. Please..." she licks her chops and settles down on the bed. "...Show this prey what they miss out upon for being food."
>...Your wife wants you to rape this doe, and for some reason, you're getting aroused at the disgusting thought.
>The doe watches the rising tent in your pants with alarm, shaking her head and babbling something behind her gag. Under her tail, you see her hairless pussy quiver.
>You get even harder.
>Licking her chops again, your wife reaches out and undoes your belt, letting your cock pop free. She takes your length in her hand and kisses the tip, bringing you to full mast. "Ravage the prey, O' husband," she purrs.
>The damn breaks, and you abandon your doubts. You seize the doe's hips roughly and drive yourself into her in a single savage thrust. She's dry, and you know you felt something in her tear.
>Despite her screaming and sobbing, you brutally rape the poor thing, treating her with none of the tender love you would your wife. Meanwhile, your wife watches, her tail slowly wagging and her eyes wide with fascination.
>You're disgusted with yourself, but it feels so GOOD that you keep going.
>The doe writhes as she's forced into pain-laced, dirty orgasms over and over. Deer anthros are quick shots sexually, they have to be in the wild, where danger lurks, and the poor doe's brain is beginning to fry itself from overload.
>Once she forced herself to lucidity and tried to fight back, but your wife pounced on the doe. Your wife pushed the doe's head down and poised her fangs around the prey anthro's neck, stilling her.
>All the doe could do is sob quietly.
>When your peak hit, you hilted and flooded the doe's womb with a roar of animalistic satisfaction, and your unwilling partner cried out in shame as yet another orgasm rocked her body.
>The doe collapsed, exhausted.
>YOur wife was so riled up at the display she just saw that she ripped her own clothes off and presented herself to you. Her loins were sopping wet, and she looked back at you, panting like a bitch in heat.
>Neither of you bother to move the near-unconscious doe, and she's forced to suffer the extra indignity of having your and your wife's combined fluids spill across her back.
>The next day, the doe was released. Her spirit broken, she limped away.
>So began a sick game repeated every so often.
>Your wife would hunt, drag a tribal prey anthro back for you, and you would violate them as she watched.
>Mom was right. Marrying an animal turned you into one.

>Be dark lord
>Anthro heroes barge into your dungeon with the intention to slay you
How would you handle them?

>Lock the wolf Hero in dungeon and have your way with his party
>The tiger Amazon given to my personal guards, reduced to piece of fuck-meat to be raped and abused
>The rabbit Witch given to alchemists to experiment on, being reduced to braindead bimbo who can only think about sex
>The bull Warrior sissyfied by mages into a scrawny femboy to serve and be their fucktoy
>The goat Priestess mind broken by inquisitors, until she started preaching about human superiority
>The doe Hunteress used for training hunters in catching new slaves and raped by whichever recruit catches her
>The mouse Thief reduced to pet on leash, forced to walk on all four and used by anyone
>The mare Princess made into my personal sex slave and made to bear my children
>after half a year let the Hero see what his party was reduced to

I know there's a hierarchy of anthros that goes along the lines of Female > Futa > Furboi
But how about within those categories?
Since anthros have no power and no possessions, anthros rely on physical assets instead to establish further hierarchy
So for >>53911103 the rankings would be
>Brown furred female for fattest ass
>Red/white female for having pussy and good markings
>White furboi for having best furboi ass of the three
>Grey and orange furboi being last and up to personal preference, grey for me since I like his turquoise boihole
Or for another example >>53913210
>Big titty kobold with large, ribbed and very curvy horns used as a pillow and allowed to feed her master with her body after assumedly being nutted in first.
>Second bustiest kobold with curvy horns showing her affection by licking her masters fingers after going second.
>Third kobold has average tits and is currently pleasuring her human, no obvious outliers beyond possibly wider hips and a second pair of horns and cheek markings like the first two kobolds but may also have a non visual attribute like being very energetic or having good pussy.
>Fourth and fifth kobolds by the foot of the bed going next, mostly average besides the one on the right having tiny secondary horns, most likely very well behaved and broken in.
>Sixth kobold watching respectfully, smaller than average breasts and small horns along with small cheek markings.
>Seventh kobold with smallest tits, no markings at all, and large straight horns (may be less status vs curved and work less well as handlebars) possibly a recent acquisition by her drooling from both ends and needing a hand to keep her from jumping on the bed.
Their attire follows this ranking as well.
>Big titty kobold in expensive form fitting lacy black lingerie with jewelry on her horns, fingers, and toes to reinforce her position.
>Second bustiest kobold in much the same, though her lingerie looks to be less expensive.
>Third kobold on top of her master is decorated like the first two, perhaps even more so than the second, there may be a struggle happening for the runner up spot.
>Fourth and fifth kobolds mostly naked save for earrings worth more than they are, the one on the right being above the left one due to her extra small horns and earrings.
>Sixth kobold in plain underwear and halter, would be bottom rung if not for the next one.
>Seventh kobold in only a metal collar, no clothes and no jewelry, probably being tried out and only kept for her enthusiasm and fat ass.

How would you rank the various species of anthro in a scale of /collar/ing ease?
>Dogs and Horses practically collar themselves. They're so domesticated that they totally live under humanity's banner.
>Rats, Cows, Sheep, Pigs and other common farm anthros need only the promise of care and safety to take the collar.
>Wolves and common Cats require a bit of convincing but never need force.
>Foxes, Coyotes, and Black Bears need coercion into wearing a collar, then need time to acclimate. Force might be required for feisty ones.
>Deer, Weasels, Rabbits, Racoons, Bats and other skittish mammal anthros need to be captured and tamed, sometimes with force.
>Big Cats, Brown Bears, Polar Bears, many Reptiles, and pretty much every anthro with an ancestral home in Africa needs captured, then forcefully broken.

>pic (https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1664/50/1664503534331.jpg)
>the assassin femboy flits across the enemy fortress, a shadow of death
>he plies his trade with the eager intensity of one promised everything he could ever want
>for every insurgent throat opened by his blades, his beloved Master will pound his prostate just as hard
>the fact this "enthusiasm" lead to particularly gruesome remains that would serve to cow their treasonous ilk for years to come is simply a happy accident

>Flip through radio channels and every one has thirsty anthros singing their love for human cock.
>It's impossible to tell if they're female, furboi, or futa unless they give something away as they all have silky smooth feminine voices begging for cum.
>Even the news and traffic channels can't help but comment that the rhinoceros girl should've found some human dick to use her energy on instead of vandalism or that if you're stuck on the I-90 it's a good time for road head and safe to hop in your human driver's lap as cars are at a standstill.
>There's even anthro NPR where anthros breathily whisper into the mic about their experiences with humans while wet sounds shlick and fap in the background.

>All Human Radio, All the Time!
>TAMED, 93.5 FM!
>Your source for all the hottest, wettest, newest songs to hit the airwaves!
...
>It's 4 PM, girls and bois, which means it's time to pick up your phones and tell your man the Rawdog what you wanna hear!
>[Ring, ring... Ring, ring...]
>You're live on the air, who'm I talkin' to?
>Um, Rebecca?
>Becky! What do you want in your ears today, huh?
>C-Can you play "Fuck Fur" and dedicate it to, um... Anon!?
>Sounds like a real lucky guy!
>Here you go, folks, for the 12th week running, here's YOUR favourite: "Fuck Fur!"

>Your furboy stresstoy came to you today, looking all puffed up and proud of himself.
>Amused, you asked him what the strutting around is for.
>"I got a date! With Olivia Green!" He said, smiling.
>You think for a moment. Olivia... Oh! She's a fairly well-to-do and popular anthro girl. Cheerleader and honor role to boot.
>Your runt isn't terribly popular. He's got his little clique of somewhat nerdy friends and he maintains good grades, but most know who he is because of his 'association' with you. How did he get a date with Olivia?
>...Oh. This bitch is setting him up. It seems obvious after a second to think about it.
>You raise an eyebrow and warn your runt, but he waves you off. "I know what I'm doing," he says, then hesitates. "Erm. Anon? I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I don't think we can..." He blushes. "I don't think we can do our... THING anymore."
>Well then, look who grew up and pulled the thong out of his bussy.
>"Okay then," you say, waving a hand dismissively. "Have fun. Don’t say I didn’t warn you."
>He tilts his head, confused and seemingly hurt that you didn't fight harder.
>Silly little thing. He does realize you can find some new ass before the week is over, right?
>The next two weeks go by, and you watch.
>Olivia is stringing your runt along like a professional whore. He’s dropped all of his allowance on her, and you saw him by the school office asking about the school’s part-time job placement program. He carries her books, passes her friends answers to tests, gave up most of his locker space to hold her junk, and you even saw him browsing beat-up cars on his phone so he can be a ‘better boyfriend’ for her.
>Meanwhile, Olivia has paid him back with a single kiss on the cheek and more than a few backhanded comments that the runt is too love blind to see.
>Then it happened.
>You were at home on a Saturday, enjoying a book alone since Mom, Dad, and your sister are out.
>There’s a knock on your door. You head over and open it.
>The runty furboy is there, his head low and his shoulders shaking.
>Wordlessly, you let him in and lead him to your room. You barely get to sit down on the edge of your bed before he throws himself into your lap and arms, sobbing.
>You wrap him in a hug and rest your chin on his head, letting him get the worst of it out of his system. “She hurt you, didn’t she?”
>He sniffles and nods into your chest.
>”I warned you.” You click your tongue. “What did she do?”
>Through his sobs, he explains.
>Olivia and her friends badgered him into letting them into his house, and once in his room, the girls cornered him.
>They tore through his closet, finding girl clothes and collars. Some gifts from you, others he bought himself.
>They found his journal, which had mushy, and sometimes sexually explicit passages within.
>Then they forced him amid tears to admit that he was a “little gay boy” with a cellphone camera stuck in his face.
>Finally, the giggling girls left, and the runt ran to your house.
>”That everything?”
>He nods again, shuddering.
>”And here you are, crawling back to me…” Your ire rises, and it colors your voice. “What's stopping me from kicking you out and telling you to deal with this yourself?”
>He tightens his hug and shivers, mumbling “No no no, please don’t.”
>Part of you wants to be sympathetic, but it’s squashed for now.
>He needs to learn.
>Your hand darts out and seizes his muzzle in a harsh, uncomfortable tight grip, forcing his head up so his red, puffy eyes are forced to meet yours. “What's stopping me from kicking you out and telling you to deal with this yourself? Answer me.” You demand.
>”N-Nothing?” He answers.
>Your let go and pull him back into a gentle hug, and he relaxes.
>”You’ve grown on me, that's what's stopping me,” you whisper into his ear. You can see the ear turning red in a blush. “But my patience has limits. I warned you, and you didn’t listen. What are you going to do next time I warn you about something?”
>”L-Listen?”
>”Good boy. Remember that answer.”
>His tail wags, batting your leg. His muzzle breaks out into a small smile.
>”I’m going to fix this for you,” you continue, one of your hands snaking under his shirt and rubbing the soft fur of his back. “From now on, you better remember who has your back, remember who you belong to, got it?”
>He nods, his eyes wide and shining in adoration.
_+_+_+_
>On Monday, you find Olivia Green and two of her friends loitering in the hallways after class is dismissed, so you saunter on up.
>”Excuse me? Olivia?” You smile when all three girls jump. “Quick question. What model of phone to you have?”
>You can see why your runt was charmed by the cheerleader. Olivia is a coyote anthro who obviously knows how to take care of her slim, canine frame. Her fur pattern is much more tame than a typical coyote’s too, adding an air of mysticism if one wrongly assumes she’s some kind of dog anthro.
>”Uh?” The question seems to catch her flat-footed, so she reaches into her pocket and withdraws her phone to look.
>Your hand moves in a flash and swipes the device from her hand. “Oh? Interesting stuff. I was also told that you have an interesting video on here. Mind if I see it?”
>”What the fuck is your damage?!” The coyote girl snarls, trying and failing to reach her phone when you lift it above her head. “Give that back!”
>You step into Olivia’s space, startling her into stepping back into the locker behind her. Looking up at you, she suddenly seems to realize that you’re a head-and-a-half taller than her, and likely twice her weight.
>On either side, her friends remain quiet as mice.
>They feel the danger in the air as well.
>Eyes locked on Olivia’s, you lower the phone. “Unlock it.”
>Your demand isn’t loud or forceful, it doesn't need to be.
>A shaking hand rises up, and Olivia presses her thumb to the paw print reader on the side of the device, unlocking it.
>Slowly, you take your time perusing the photos and videos inside. There are a lot of the usual things, like glamor shots of scenes or food, saved dick-pics, and Olivia and her friends posing for selfies, sometimes nude, a few close-ups of Olivia’s bare tits or between her legs, and a humiliating one of Olivia being spit-roasted in the boy’s locker room.
>The videos are much the same, until you come across the one with your furboy in it.
>You watch the whole thing, seeing your runt reduced to a crying mess by the girls. When it ends, you smile, delete the video, and hand the phone back to the shaken cheerleader you’re standing over.
>”Thats a funny one,” you smile, looking at the coyote and her friends. “But it’s one I only care to see once. Anywhere.” Your smile falls, and your eyes snap back to Olivia’s. “You get what I mean, right?”
>She nods once, too frightened to do much else.
>You return home, and your furboy is already there in your room, waiting with his hands balled in his lap.
>”It’s done.”
>He almost leaps into your arms, mashing his muzzle into your lips in a sloppy, delighted kiss.
>With a grunt, you grip the scruff of his neck in a puppy hold, and he goes limp, letting you shove your tongue into his muzzle with impunity.
>He is YOURS, yours to use, to humiliate, to do ANYTHING with.
>No one else is allowed to use him like you do.

Chapter 4: Rabbits
Part 1, Society and Physique
>Rabbit tribes are not as common as many others, but often have a suprisingly large population size. They tend to breed fast and often, and their communities are very closely knit with strong familial and community bonds, so they are more reluctant than other anthros to split off into separate tribes. Some rabbit tribes can reach absolutely shocking population sizes.
>Rabbit tribes are rather unique, in that they will often (but not always) construct a system of underground dens to live in just under the surface, rather than your typical tribal village. This, combined with their tendency to keep to themselves and remain isolated, can make finding their tribe tricky.
>Rabbit tribes are usually quite peaceful and passive, despite their tendency to avoid outsiders. However, be warned– when their community is pushed to the brink of destruction, I have seen them rally and fight back with a ferocity and determination seldom seen amongst the anthros. Thankfully, I do not think it likely that any of you readers would do enough to earn such a response.
>Rabbits also seem fond of keeping little gardens of herbs, and sometimes even vegetables or fruits. In fact, I would recommend nurturing a trading relationship if you have any desire to. It's an effective way to earn the trust of any rabbit community you seek to interact with!
>Physically, most species of rabbit anthros are small in stature (just how small varies between species and region). They are excellent at jumping, and capable of startling bursts of speed, though their coordination and strength is rather lacking. Do mind the sharp front teeth, though. They're not usually biters, but if they do nip you it can be quite unpleasant!
>As for the sexual performance of the men... well. To be perfectly blunt, they are possibly the poorest mates I've ever seen. You may wonder how this is, considering how adept they seem at reproducing. Well, that is because they have high libidos, eager to breed often. Unfortunately for the females, "often" does not mean long, or well. The male rabbit's genitalia is remarkably small, and they seem almost genetically designed to orgasm as quickly as physically possible.
>On the occasions I have had the misfortune of witnessing their attempts, I have never once seen one last more than 5 minutes. Most seem to last between 30 seconds to 2 minutes. You may currently be discounting this as the exaggerated mockery typical of the more boastful and fanciful traveler. I assure you, I am dedicated to accuracy in all my writings, and timed most of these encounters with my pocket watch.
The shortest lasted 4 seconds.
God deliver these women from the hands of their men.
Part 2, Domestication and Ownership
>Oftentimes, the hardest part of taming a rabbit anthro is catching the darn thing! They're small, fast, and their large ears and keen noses make it hard to sneak up on them. To further complicate things, many of them have a skittish nature, making it difficult to convince one to come willingly. My advice– take advantage of the tunnel vision they get when they panic and run. It's not too hard to make them trip up by leading them into difficult terrain, or a previously laid trap.
>Once you do have one, you'll likely find a female rabbit anthro fairly easy to manage. Taming can often be achieved simply through applying liberal amounts of dick. And even if your rabbit is more resistant than most, keeping one contained shouldn't be too hard.
>The advantages of a rabbit anthro pet should quickly become apparent. Like the males, they have an extremely high sex drive, and are quick to orgasm. UNLIKE the males, they do not suffer the curse of the one-and-done. In fact, experienced rabbit girls are sometimes capable of feats of sexual stamina that could almost compare to our own!
>They are also quite soft, cuddly, and dare I day– adorable. Just be mindful of their size, if you find yourself in possession of one of the smaller breeds. Getting used to the size of a human's member can be seriously challenging task for some. But the rewards, if you can manage to acclimate one to it... well. That should be self-explanatory.
>Rabbit girls are not only endlessly willing to fuck, but also easy to pleasure and perfectly capable of taking care of their carnal needs themselves, should you not have time to indulge with them. They are also more easily impregnated than the typical anthro, and seem predisposed towards having twins, triplets, or even more.
>I wholeheartedly recommend rabbit anthros as pets, especially for anyone looking to raise a family, or breed slave stock. Due to their hyperactive sexual appetite and sensitivity to pleasure, I also highly recommend them for anyone inexperienced or uncertain in their sexual abilities– OR, for the particularly skilled master who wants a pet they can make absolutely melt, provided they have the experience to identify their furthest physical limit and utterly demolish them without crossing the it.

Chapter 5: Four Major Felids
Part 1, Society and Physique
>Their are a great many distinct species of felid anthros, but in this chapter we will focus on the four arguably most well known: Lions, Tigers, Leopards, and Cheetahs.
>Tribes of these species tend towards being warlike and aggressive, along with having a distinct sense of pride in their own tribe and race. They are often ferocious, brave... and arrogant. The latter of which is occasionally their downfall.
>Each of these species have dangerous claws and teeth, natural weapons that any prepared frontiersman must be wary of! A wild felid is never unarmed. They also have quite long tails, which aid them in balance and agility.
>Lion anthros are the most prideful of the bunch. Some tribes will believe their race is superior to all other anthros, or at least to prey species, and are particularly prone to underestimating humans. They are strong and fast enough to match with your average human warrior, forcing us to rely on humankind's natural stamina advantage when fighting one. They are also the most cooperative in their tactics, preferring to hunt and attack together in groups more frequently than their independence-valuing brethren.
>The males of the species are particularly proud of their hair and manes, flaunting them as a status symbol. Strangely, the females are considered the primary hunters (though not the primary warriors) for the tribe. In fact, I would venture to say that many of the males seem downright lazy in my experience, delegating most of the active jobs to their women. Indeed, male lions have a dominance hierarchy, with their tribal leader typically amassing a harem of lionesses to cater to his commands.
>Tiger tribes are quite prideful as well, only a little less so than lions. They are even stronger than lions however, with the average tiger anthro matching or even exceeding the strength of most trained human soldiers (Though the upper potential of our two species' strength seems roughly the same). Again, stamina is our key advantage here, as far as combat is concerned.
>Tiger tribes are a bit more cautious than some of their brethren species, tending more towards ambushes and stealth as a preferred tactic. Their tribes are usually found in areas with heavy foliage, to facilitate this. They also value the thrill of the hunt to an extreme degree, becoming immensely excited by a good chase.
>In fact, on multiple occasions I have heard of tigresses working themselves into such a fervor during their hunting of a trespassing human, that when they manage to pin their quarry they end up succumbing instantly to the human's charm in the heat of their adrenaline rush, furiously mating with him instead of their original goal of killing or capturing. If the human is a skilled enough lover to effectively leverage their superiority as mates, this can result in the tigress effectively taming herself ON you, in a bizarre scenario reversal.
>Leopard anthros are not nearly as strong, but display superior agility and speed. They are graceful hunters that take pride in their skill, as well as in the beauty of their spotted fur and lithe bodies. The grace of a leopard can be beautiful, but don't let it distract you– they are not above striking whilst one is unprepared.
>Leopard tribes will sometimes construct their villages as a series of treehouses, and are particularly fond of using trees as perches to observe and attack from. One poor soldier I encountered after his centuria had come under arrow fire from a leopard ambush was ranting in terror that "the trees were attacking them."

One poor soldier I encountered after his centuria had come under arrow fire from a leopard ambush was ranting in terror that "the trees were attacking them."
>Cheetah tribes prefer wide open areas and blitz tactics, and it's no secret why. Alarmingly, this is a species whose speed does not just match a humans– I must admit, it surpasses us entirely. However, this is not without it's drawbacks. The stamina of a cheetah is lacking, as is their strength and fortitude. If you are ever forced into conflict with a cheetah, I impore you: stand your ground. Let the Predator become the prey, and deliver itself to you.
>It should be noted that some Cheetah "tribes" don't settle into tribal villages at all, but rather live as nomads roving a larger area. Some of them even engage in raiding behavior, preying on other tribes and frontier settlements. When it comes to defense, however, they are often ill-prepared.
>Now, after singing many praises of the abilities of these species, I must broach the matter of their most egregious trait, something present amongst the males of ALL of these species: Their penises are covered in fleshy barbs. These barbs are pointed inwards, making it difficult to retract their shaft once it is entered, and severely hampering their range of motion during mating. Even worse, such an unpleasant attribute can make sex unpleasant for the female at best, and actually painful at worst.
>Perhaps it isn't fair to blame an anthro for the physical trait they were born with. But personally, I can't help but feel a tinge of righteous anger whenever I see one of those males claim a mate as "theirs," despite the physical incompatibility. I believe THAT is the true height of their arrogance. Wholly irresponsible of them, in my admittedly biased opinion.
Part 2, Domestication and Ownership
>There are a few effective tactics one can employ, when seeking to acquire a pet from one of these species. Their typical overestimation of their own abilities and inexperience with humans can be used to bait one into hunting you, much like as described in the tiger section. A prepared frontiersman can swiftly turn the tables on their supposed "hunter" and dominate them with either strength, stamina, or sexual ability.
>Another strategy is the tried and true "run them down" method, that works on so many different anthros. Even if they are faster than you initially, a human's stamina should prove superior. Pace yourself, and soon enough you'll find an exhausted anthro girl waiting for you, helpless and too spent to put up a fight.
>Additionally, I have found a rather unconditional tactic to be suprisingly succesful. You can try simply taking one of your other anthro pets out into the open, on the edge or within eyesight of the hunting grounds of your desired prey. Make love to your pet in full view of any curious onlookers, and you might just attract an admirer, who is so captivated by the sight of an anthro actually ENJOYING the act of sex to such a degree, that their curiosity may outweigh their caution...
>Once you have one of these species, I will admit, they can be tricky to tame. Prideful, independent, and often fiery in ddispostion, they can certainly be a challenge. I wouldn't recommend them to a beginner. There's no easy shortcut to taming them in most cases, I'm afraid. It will take timeand patience.
>But when you finally do– the result is worth it. Not only are they passionate and skillfull lovers, when properly domesticated they can display shocking loyalty and affection. Some will even become remarkably submissive for their masters, in stark contrast to their typical demeanor! And once you've gotten past any initial resistance, I assure you they will be VERY thankful for you having introduced them to non-barbed cock.
>Each species has their own unique appeals, as well! Lions are energetic and eager lovers, tigers are absolutely WILD in bed, leopards display graceful movements hard to find a match for, and cheetahs can move their hips so fast that it'll leave the BOTH of you panting!
>I definitely recommend these four felid species to anyone looking for a passionate lover, a loyal and loving companion, or just a challenge! Anyone capable and willing to put in the proper work and time will undoubtedly find themselves with no regrets– and no lack of excitement.

>Alright! It's 2:00PM exactly, which means it's time to switch to Darcy for her Flower Hour! All yours Darcy!
>Thanks, Daddy! Flower Hour is when our lady listeners call in for a few tips they can use later tonight~!
>Our first caller is Sienna the Doe, calling from the small town of Great Woods just north of here.
>Miss Sienna, you're on!
>"Hey, Darcy!"
>Hey, Sienna! How's Great Woods!?
>"Not great to be honest."
>Ooh, ouch! What's wrong, girl?"
>"Everything! There's a single human in my high school and he won't look at me!
>Oh no! Only a single Humie?
>"Uh-huh! I'm still a virgin because of that!"
>Dang, your town is fur central! Wee-Woo-Wee-Woo! Any humans listening in, the town of Great Woods needed YOUR cock yesterday! So tell me, Sienna. How do you dress?
>"Um... I guess normally?"
>Like what's your style? Girly-girl or tomboyish? What are you wearing now?
>"Um... shirt... and jeans..."
>Yeah, I think I see the problem. If you really want to attract that humie boy you're going to need to show yourself off! Miniskirts and hot pink thongs! Go braless for a while and let those nips stick out! By the way, are you one of those deer with the white fur under your tail and butt?
>"Y-Yeah."
>Yeah show that off, human guys go crazy over that. Cut out a larger tail hole and give him the full view at the right moment!
>"I-I think I got it! Thanks Miss Darcy!"
>You're welcome, hun! And good hunting! Call us back later when you get that cherry popped!
>Coming up next...!

>Catch burglar bat trying to steal some of your shit.
>Easily overpower her as she's barely half your size.
>Give her a choice, either be your slave or be escorted to the police, where if she has a record, will not result in a happy ending.
>She's smart, so of course she chooses the former, surely she can find some way to escape right?
>After slapping a collar on her and chaining her to the bed, you demonstrate how little power she possessed now and had your way with her.
>She wasn't a bad lay, her small body was tight in all the right places and had surprisingly big tits for her size.
>Once the pleading changed from begging to be released to begging for your cum, you knew it wouldn't be long before you broke her.
>A few more days of this and you felt confident enough to let her off her chain, the newly liberated bat taking the opportunity to do some chores around the house.
>She liked to pretend she was your roommate, it made her situation more bearable for her, a little nugget of hope she could hold onto despite her circumstance.
>You reminded her every night that you owned her fair and square, unlike her trying to steal your possessions, which ironically she had become herself.
>One day, when you cared enough, you asked what she had even been after, you weren't super flashy and your valuables weren't exactly easy to get to.
>She simply points to a gem you had in the window, some cheap glass shit you had bought online.
>You laugh in her face, telling her as much as she flushes with anger and embarrassment.
>She insists it came from her land, and that it was obscenely precious to her.
>Apparently this three buck paperweight was something called a "chaos emerald", whatever the fuck that meant.
>There were several kinds and each had different colors, but were all still called emeralds for some reason.
>Humoring her, you pluck the cheap thing off it's stand and ask what it was worth to her, turning the gem in your hand so that it caught the light.
>She quickly replied with "Anything." to which you reminded her she had nothing you didn't already have.
>Dangling the green piece of plastic over her head, you taunt her with a few dollars that she couldn't hope to afford.
>Her eyes never left the gem as she came up with a payment, all her stolen items and riches she had accrued over the years, all yours for the rock.
>You had her write down the location so you could see for yourself, but weren't so naive to leave her alone and brought her along, keeping the emerald in your pocket.
>It was a long trip, eventually ending up at a storage facility of some sort, her large unit in the back.
>Expecting nothing, you were blown away when she opened the door, more money than you had seen in your entire life behind it.
>Jewelry, currency from around the world, luxury cars, even a fucking helicopter was in there.
>Tossing the piece of junk over your shoulder, the bat yelps and dives for it, barely catching the gem before it hit the floor.
>Stuffing your pockets with some money and easily pawned items, you look to the bat as she starts chuckling, cradling the emerald obsessively.
>All of a sudden the thing starts to glow, and she points it at you with a sneer.
>She says that she regrets being so sloppy in her theft, but that she won't have to worry about that anymore, the gem glowing brighter.
>You watch her stand there pointing the chaos emerald at you for a moment, a tinge of fear in your gut as you realize she might have been right all along.
>After a minute of nothing happening, your fear was slowly put to rest.
>The smirk slowly falling of her face, the bat shakes the emerald a few times, looking confused.
>As you march up to her, she then looks worried.
>Snagging the emerald from her, the light immediately goes out, turning back into the worthless rock it was.
>Protesting, the bat whines and reaches for the gem, claiming the two of you had a deal.
>You simply grab her with one hand and throw her in the back of one of your new cars, closing the door and driving off back home.
>She wouldn't shut up the entire way back, even after being threatened, so you eventually just let her have the glowing thing, a fair trade for silence.
>You watch her in the mirror try and do something with it, but everything she attempted only resulted in her making the gem glow.
>Once you got home, you turned in for the night, planning on how to spend your new fortune and telling the bat not to stay up too late with her nightlight.
>The next morning comes and it seemed like business as usual, the bat waking you up and having breakfast ready for you before you went to work.
>Well, not anymore now, you called your boss and told him in the most colorful way possible that you quit, hanging up and enjoying your bacon.
>You didn't have to worry about a job anymore, the money in your pockets from yesterday alone would let you live comfortably for a year.
>The bat was still obsessing over the emerald as you ate, it was the only thing she had done since you let her have it.
>Bags were under her eyes as it seemed she hadn't slept, assumedly having stared at the emerald all night long.
>Interest sufficiently piqued, you ask her name and about where she came from, and if everyone there was as much a rock freak as she was.
>She responds to your questions absentmindedly, her attention wholly focused on the glowing emerald.
>You get some interesting information, including something she had initially left out about the emeralds.
>Apparently they were incredibly powerful, able to do things that were basically magic and reality warping.
>You didn't believe a word of it, yet she seemed entirely convinced.
>Maybe the rocks were part of her religion or something, in any case it was good for another laugh.
>You made sure Rouge didn't forget she had duties to do and not to spend all day staring at the thing, getting comfortable on the couch as you enjoy a lazy day.
>You're woken up a few hours later by Rouge vacuuming, giving you a show in the process as she flits around the room in tight clothing.
>You saw she kept the gem in her cleavage, loathe to part with it as her sole possession in this world.
>She wouldn't let go of it even when you fucked her that night, clutching it close as the green glow illuminated your bodies in the dark room.
>A week went by and you couldn't be happier, you had gotten a sexy slave and enough money to last you until you died, your three dollar online investment paying for itself a million times over.
>Rouge had become much more docile since she'd gotten the gem, you had expected some escape attempts but there had been none.
>She still stared at it from time to time, still keeping the piece of glass on her at any given moment.
>She was so well behaved that you took her outside with you on occasion, always dressing herself in skimpy, revealing clothes.
>You commented on this as she was making lunch one day, praising her for style of dress.
>Rouge acted confused, saying all the clothes she wore were the same ones she had always worn, even as her nipples peeked out from under her shirt.
>When you point this out, she tries to pull her shirt down, only for it to ride back up and expose her nubs again.
>She shrugs it off as gaining some weight as she hadn't been as mobile lately since being in your ownership, something you shrugged off as well.
>A day or two later, Rouge splits her pants open as she tries to clean under the couch, the seam unable to contain her fat ass.
>Her weight had increased quite a bit since you had first fucked her, as you couldn't throw her around as easily as you used to.
>She didn't seem to be getting fat really, but she was definitely filling out, her shirts unable to cover her areola anymore.
>Another week and you're woken to the sound of her struggling, trying in vain to fit into a bra that was several sizes to small.
>She had asked for your help, and when you forced the back to latch, she struggled to breathe for a moment before the bra snapped off and shot around the room.
>Needless to say she went topless that day.
>After this, she found she couldn't fit in her pants any longer either, eventually convincing you to buy her an elliptical to work out on and burn some of her fat.
>The thing was, her stomach was just about as flat as when you'd first met, all her weight had ended up in her tits and ass.
>Still it would give her something to do in her "free" time other than stare at the rock, and you didn't mind seeing her get sweaty as her mostly nude body jiggled and wobbled while she exercised.
>Unfortunately for her, after about another week, not only did she not lose any weight, she kept gaining it, letting out a frustrated groan as she stepped on the bathroom scale one morning.
>It didn't bother you any, in fact her body fit her new life perfectly, going from a curvy thief to an extremely voluptuous slut.
>Her dexterity she possessed was completely thrown out of wack by the extra load on her chest and ass, making her quite clumsy at times.
>You had put together what was most likely happening a while ago, but Rouge seemed none the wiser.
>Once you had made sure it wasn't radioactive, Rouge's claims to the chaos emerald's power seemed more legitimate.
>Only they seemed to not work the way she thought they did.
>After a month, you decide to tell her your theory, thinking the look on her face when she realized what was happening would be hilarious.
>Sitting her down, you tell Rouge that you had figured out the emerald's power, and that if she wanted to know it, she'd have to willingly give herself to you, completely.
>She thinks about it for all of two seconds before excitedly accepting.
>Casually, you explain to her in simple terms that the chaos emerald was the one responsible for her fat tits and ass, that it's power was probably some fertility idol of her country.
>Rogue immediately rejected this idea, almost flat out calling you stupid.
>So you had a little bet with her, you'd keep the gem for a week or so and see if she stopped growing or not, if she kept going up bra sizes then you'd admit she was right and keep her as a simple slave.
>If she was wrong and she plateaued, you'd own her mind, body, and soul.
>She was less keen on this, but eventually relented, fishing out the emerald from her expansive cleavage and handing it over like it was a part of her.
>You simply plop the warm gem back into its spot in the window, the gem refracting light from the sun instead of making its own.
>Over the next few days, Rouge stopped working out and watching what she ate, no point in helping you win after all.
>But even as she got a little belly, her tits and ass mostly stayed the same, their growth pretty much halted.
>As the sixth day rolled around, Rouge tried to play it off, not wanting to admit to herself, let alone you, that her precious emerald only made boobs and ass grow.
>She eventually wanted to extend the time limit, and you agreed, certain in your victory but letting her deny it until the very end.
>After thirteen days Rouge was beside herself, her bust hadn't grown a single cup size the entire time and she couldn't stand to lie to herself anymore.
>It was in that moment, with tears in her eyes that she accepted her loss, giving herself to you wholly.
>The only thing she asked in return was the emerald.
>So, gently, you pluck the gem from it's spot and hand it to her, the bat holding it close as it glowed again as if to reassure her.
>Half a month later and you had the perfect slave, though she doesn't look at it that way, preferring to think of herself as your soulmate or life partner.
>She still never let go of the emerald, maybe out of habit or comfort you didn't know, all you were sure about is that her tits and ass started growing again.
>To what end you weren't sure, but the sight and feel of her nude body never got old.
>Every morning you wake up to rouge giving you a blowie or boobjob, sometimes finishing you off in bed or leading you into the shower where you paint her insides white before she washes you.
>She then sits in your lap at the table as you grope her obscene body, literally feeding you breakfast a forkful at a time.
>You hadn't needed to buy milk in months.
>Then she'd go about her duties for the day, usually completing them by the time you return home from wherever you went out to.
>If you didn't immediately bend her over a piece of furniture, she'd get on her elliptical, and after a few minutes of jiggling she'd finish her workout by bouncing on your cock.
>Evenings were up in the air, maybe you'd stay home, go out again, or take her with you in some extremely stretchy and accommodating clothes.
>But every night was the same, you'd end the day fucking her senseless, her gem illuminating her pleasured face as she came again and again.
>Rouge was content with her new life, the emerald doing exactly what it was supposed to, giving her everything she ever wanted and fulfilling her in a way she hadn't ever dreamed of.

>It was with drunken laugher that Anon and his friends stumbled upon the female anthro shopping for the wedding dress and gangbanged her in the store, along with the employee.
>However, what she didn't expect was to like it, or to, when asked, tell them where she lives.
>Even less so did she expect for Anon and his friends to regularly visit her while her fiance was away working.
>And when they asked for the wedding date, she didn't even try to stop herself.
>So the night before was spent by her with Anon and his dozen friends, leaving her quivering, ruined and leaking, covered in sweat, piss and male semen.
>They didn't even let her shower, they just pulled the dress on her and pushed her to her furboi lover while they stood in the crowd.
>And after it was all done, as the two made their way towards the bed, Anon and his friends came in aswell.
>They put a dildo on a chair, put the furboi on it and tied him to the chair, while a train ran on the girl until she passed out.
>And then they left.

>The tribal anthros that you've been hunting for the past few months finally gather up the courage to summon their primordial twin goddesses to stop you.
>They're so confident and haughty that they don't even bother to try and sneak up on you, they just announce their presence loudly and proclaim about how they're going to enact justice on you.
>They pull out their bows and pull back the drawstrings.
>Point your hunting rifle at the older one and blow her head off, covering her sister in blood and gore.
>Her string falls loose as she just stares forward confused, turning to watch her sister, who has protected these woods unfailingly for over a thousand years, slump to the ground.
>She stands motionless, in complete shock.
>Her hands shake as she notices the blood on them.
>It was so fast, so...effortless.
>She looks back at you and now you look so much larger, so much stronger than her.
>She doesn't want to die, she doesn't want to die!
>You walk towards her and her terrified hands drop her weapon.
>She falls to her knees and begs for your forgiveness, clearly, you're the superior god.
>Slam your cock in her ass as she tells you all about the weaknesses of the village that summoned her, alongside the location of dozens of 'secret, hidden villages' full of pure maidens untouched since the world was made, that only she can find and which she was sworn to protect.
>Until she met you, of course.

>She leads you to one of the hidden villages
>The woman stare at you in awe because they never have seen a human before
>You snap your fingers and the goddess goes down on her knees and starts sucking your cock.
>The woman start to gather around the event, all wanting to see their goddess working your shaft
>When you approach orgasm she lets go of your cock and you spray your load at the closest fur woman, marking her
>She begins to eat your seed. Aroused from this act she comes closer to you and starts to go down at you as well.
>The remaining woman start to masturbate as she works your shaft
>You look over to the goddess. With tears in her eyes she looks down in shame for betraying her worshipers and her race

>Go to Asriel's house to play vidya or do homework with him
>At a given point you go "to the bathroom" for an hour or a bit more
>When you come back, is time to leave so you pick your bag and go
>Toriel goes to say goodbye and close the door with her body covered by a bed sheet
>You are invited to stay the night on saturday
>Since Asriel brother's bed can't be used, you have to sleep on Toriel's room
>Your goat friend wakes up for breakfast the day after
>Toriel is on a cleavege-revealing coat serving the plates
>You look as if a truck just rolled over you
>She looking reluctanct with a big smile
At least you discovered that "six" is your limit

>This was her prize, her daddy's cock ramming her matured and as of an hour ago, completely unused pussy
>This month she had managed to recruit fifteen female students, all virgins, to join your exclusive harem
>You had enjoyed the steady supply of new teens to deflower every other night
>But for now the girl deserving all the attention was the english teacher, bent over her desk and drooling like a rabid dog
>A quick glance out the open door revealed the rest of the teachers glaring jealously at their colleague
>Not only at the cock she was enjoying but the new ring around her finger, something only the highest ranking of the harem was allowed
>She howled as she felt the intense warmth of her husband's sperm flood of dormant womb
>After so many years of cleaning up after other women's bastard kids she would finally be blessed with children of her very own
>From the man she actually loved, no less
>She melted onto the table, limp and unconscious from her orgasm
>You called the physical ed teacher in, she got second place
>More hisses and curses were vocalized by the others but none would say it to the face of a tall, muscled mare who could smash their ribs in with a single kick to their chests
>But even she knelt and submissively took your wet, still pulsing cock into her mouth
>She didn't care that it tasted of a thousand other females, even being allowed to accept it into her mouth was a high honor
>By the time you fed her your second shot of cum her arousal had created a puddle underneath her
>It eventually formed a mirror that gave you a good look at her desperately winking horse cunt
>Too bad, maybe if she worked a little harder you'd be willing to seed her as well
>In third was math teacher, a cute fox barely out of her internship
>She would be allowed to eat the dripping cum straight out of the english teacher's gaping hole
>Everybody else would have to settle with watching, a powerful incentive for trying harder

>Taking your deer gf out into the woods so you can 'hunt' her with paintballs while she ducks and dives naked through the undergrowth.
>It reminds her of how the two of you met.
>Fuck her in the backseat of your car while she's covered in paint, mud, scratches, sweat and tears.

You're a judge and you're being brought over to a difficult case. A jaywalker was recorded and identified as a male anthro of some variant. After the police reviewed all the proof, they narrowed down the list of anthros that might be responsible (from left to right):
>free anthro, physical worker, age 24,
>>clean criminal record
>>claims he was walking home after drinking in a anthro bar, denies that he would've been that drunk after 6 beers as to jaywalk
>>>might've been drunk enough to think we wouldn't catch him for this
>collared anthro, servant, age 19,
>>clean criminal record
>>>has served his master after voluntarily being collared at the age of 18 for no compensation
>>claims he was sent to the store to buy a pack of candy after his owner and his half a dozen friends "gaped" him, states that jaywalking never even crossed his mind
>>>he might have been "gaped" enough that he took a shortcut, owner revealed he was indeed "gaped" and that he had stuffed a massive buttplug up his servants ass before sending him on his way
>free anthro, office worker, age 21
>>criminal record reveals offences of:
>>spitting chewing gum on the sidewalk (age 18), was offered collaring, upon their refusal was re-judged into 1 year as public gloryhole for 20 hours a week in fox quarter
>>littering (throwing a bottlecap next to a trash bin during his celebration for finishing the previous sentence) (age 19), was offered collaring, upon their refusal was re-judged into 1 year as public gloryhole for 40 hours a week in wolf quarter
>>misdemeanor (aggressive posturing and looks towards officers when arrested) (now), offered collaring, punishment is chastity + muzzle in addition to gloryhole service for 1 year for 80 hours a week in stallion quarter
>>claims he was walking home after a tiring day at the office and that he would never, ever breach the law again
>>>repeated offences make him the prime suspect
It is left up to you, as the sole judge to assign any and all punishments.

The setting is pretty much our early 1970's, except there is global peace between nations as humans internationally primarily concern themselves with domming and brainwashing anthros into prime servants, completely obedient and subservient. The human population is slightly under half a billion, while the anthros count well over 3 billion.
The anthros are completely subservient, however the free anthros are allowed quite a lot of freedoms (of living space, of personal property and rights, of jobs...) and make up a bit over 2 billion, while the rest are the collared anthros, who give up their rights to everything other than not being mutilated/killed to a human in exchange for being able to personally and directly serve their human masters.
Anthros have a deep reverance for humans and will generally do what the humans tell them, short of truly retarded things. An anthro male would without much convincing let himself be tied up while an human takes his wife. Anthros have also greatly normalized sex and sexual acts.
The quarters are segments of the city where certain sub-species of anthros are expected/incentivized to live.
Punishments are expected to not (permanently) main/mutilate the anthro. The tamer punishments are usually exhausting/humiliating sexual acts, while the more extreme ones are more uncomfortable/exhausting/humiliating. The most extreme punishments may be long lasting and affect anthros, tho almost all punishments are very cruel and humiliating by human standards.
An anthro may expect to be put in a bitchsuit for half a decade for trying to commit small theft like chewing gum. Or he might end up having to anally service horses daily for a decade if he lies to a human. He might end up having to wear an armbinder with a anal hook to keep him in proper posture if he tries pickpocketry. Or he might end up wearing a chastity cage because he looked at a human with anger.
Anthros are very subservient and broken in to the extreme.

"Meeeat, we-he-heeere fuck'ng Me-hee-hee-hee-eaat~" sobbed the Aquatic Kobold as she squirmed against her bonds. The hooks in her gills filled her with an oxyginated high as her senses were overwhelmed with the fate of her mutual slaves. A few moments ago, there were five little Kobold slaves. Now though...
>KVRRRRRRRRRRRRNGKRKRRRRR
The third one couldn't scream. Two others had gone in before him. They screamed. He screamed too, inbetween jacking himself off, at least before the gears had shredded his little cock and balls. It felt so good having them pulverized, Kobolds take abuse well like that. His lungs had been popped with the threshers like the others, but he couldn't go down further. A rib was stuck in the side, leaving the poor little mulcherbait to struggle. Held between oblivion and escape in vain, his organs slipped down the metal jaws like the chain of an anchor, whipping away. A sputtered gurgle escaped his mouth as he felt the end's precipice, his poor little body at the mercy of the world and its kafkaesque indifference to him. The human groaned, and retrieved a long metal pole.
"Ugggh, c'mon..."
As the Kobold struggled against the sides, the human Man took the stick and gently pressed it against the little meat's chest. The kobold's survival instinct overtook how much he loved being destroyed, loved watching others be destroyed, and he grabbed at the stick, not really even sure what for, as with a loud snap, a jolt of pain signaled the return of those chomping crushing gears. The Kobold's brain was again, flooded with crushing, and all thoughts but pain and becoming meat over took his mind. And nothing but the sharp crunching gears overtook the pointlessly firing slurry of neurons and bone that was that little Kobold's head. The aquatic pissed herself and squirmed, crying and begging;
"Meeeee~ Meee next, Pleee-hee-hee-eeeeese~"
Her final accompaniment was a terrestrial Kobold, and she'd been more apprehensive to the fate of the others. She tried to escape after watching the girl go in, but all she'd done was fall on her chest, leading to a few painful slaps on her ass, and the pile of flesh that was her mutual slaves was sludging closer, the sickly smell of offal, blood and guts wafting in through her snout. She was going to die. She was going to be turned into more of that sludge in the pile, there was no escaping this. So... now or never then, she considered. A portion of meat from one of the slaves has slid towards the snout, and she thought of taking a bite. She feared that would lead to her going next sooner, but what was a minute or two between meat? She slowly darted her eyes between the machine, the boy now well through the entry and being converted into fresh bloody chunks, the other girl threshing and sobbing in a predated blissout, and a warm piece of flesh just waiting for a little taboo. The apprehensive opened her maw, before clamping it shut. The Human was coming.
"Alright then..."
He sighed and reached down to grip the fins of the noisy aquatic, who gasped and eyes widened knowing, she was next.
"OH THANK YOU! *SOB* THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M C-*SOB* I'M GONNA DIE AND I'M CU-"
A quick punch to match her other shiner shut her and made her squirt out a little before gurgling a moan and squirming in her ropes. The Human sighed and, while readjusting his grip to the Aquatic's neck closing her gills and choking her, he pulled out a large sharp cleaver from a rack on the counter beside them. He made quick work of the edible twine the whiny grillbait was wrapped in (The Human didn't want to untie His morsels as He made them into meat.) and let her limbs and tail dangle loosely in his grip. They'd atrophied from days of bondage, waiting for their destruction, which now came personally to the little chatterbox. The Human laid this meat on the counter and...
KSHUNK!
"uuuooOAOAAAAAAAAGGH-"
KSHUNK!
"URRAAAGGGGGAAAAHHHHH, AAAAG-"
KSHUNK!
Her limbs sliced off like butter in his hands.
The cleaver cleaned flesh, bone and flesh again in one clean powerful hammer down. And as she tried to prop herself up with a barely functioning arm running on adrenaline
KSHUNK!
In moments, what had been a weepy aquatic kobold in love with snuff, into a weepy kobold fuckmeat nugget, spurting blood and cumming itself as she bit through her own tongue, spurting bloody moans and shrieks. The Human was merciless, and leaving the poor girl no time to breath, proceeded to slice her tail down the bottom and peel the meat right off her bone. That got her shrieking and wheezing, bucking about bloody. All the while, the Human was trick-shotting her limbs through the tresher, as more chunks of slave meat poured, now coating the snout of the oppurtunistic cannibal.
"Don't think I don't see you there," said the human as he put down the cleaver and retrieved a straight razor to dig at the Aquatic's neck. Her screams were literally cut short, and her eyes widened as she gazed in self-destructive ecstasy, screaming and mouthing the thoughts "I love you" to her Human. He barely registered her confession as she died for Him, still monitoring the last little meat to destroy.
"Go ahead, eat as much as you want. I was going to pump them into your gut as we fucked anyway."
The human took the bloody limbs of the other girl, freshly snuffed and started feeding them into the machine, rubbing the pussy of the last kobold with His foot.
"God, you're all such MEAT aren't you? You actually, like-"
The Human bent down and pulled up the little thing by its ear to see the decapitated head of the Aquatic. A look of bliss and release was frozen on her face.
"You freaks actually fucking enjoy this. You WANT to die don't you?"
The Human pressed the dead girl's snout to the living one's, slurry between her teeth.
"You want to BE like this."
She did.
